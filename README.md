# Karatu_Data_Engineering_First_Semester_Project
The goal of this project is to apply the principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) to build a simple Student Management System. This system will allow the management of students, courses, and enrollments, demonstrating the use of classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation.
